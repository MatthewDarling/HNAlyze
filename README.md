Git clone and then run `lein repl`.

## Usage

Start with the `get-comments` function, which takes a story id, and then `parse-api-json` on the return value of that. `def` the return value of that function, because you'll be using it for all the others.

For now the only interface is the REPL, but I might add some command line functionality or learn enough ClojureScript to put it on Heroku. It would be interesting to have sort of an interactive thing, where you start by providing a story ID and then get a bunch of info about it. That's pretty much what the REPL provides, though...
